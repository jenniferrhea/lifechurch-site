    of your day today. Did you see Him in your kid’s laughter, the homeless person

    good sex, bad sex, and great sex?  And what about those awkward topics that few
    people discuss openly?  Weve come a long way since the days when TV couples like
    Ward and June Cleaver slept in separate beds... and today's kids aren't nearly
    as innnocent as Wally and the Beaver.  Sometimes it's the things you have to unlearn
    about sex that help you understand what great sex really is.

    had all the riches in the world, but still he sought more. More money, more sex,
    more power. And what he found is that the problem with having everything in the
    world…is having everything in the world. Explore the book of Ecclesiastes as Solomon’s
    personal discovery that, even though he tried and he tried…he couldn’t get no
    satisfaction. His ultimate conclusion was that following God and His commandments
    is all that matters.

  description_medium: Over 2000 years ago, God used twelve ordinary men to transform
    the world. As followers of Christ, the call on our lives is no less. We are to
    be a dangerous people, allowing ourselves to be Gods vessel for accomplishing
    extraordinary things. When is the last time you believed God for something extraordinary?
    Prepare yourself to take a risk and go where no church has gone before!
