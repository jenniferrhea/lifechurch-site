We’re celebrating Easter around the globe. Find a LifeChurch.tv Easter experience near you or anywhere through [Church Online](//live.lifechurch.tv).

When Jesus asks us why we doubt, our answer reveals more about our faith than our intellect. This Easter, join us for our current series, [The Counselor](/watch/the-counselor/).
